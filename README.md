# Real-time Speech Transcription Using Python
This project enables real-time speech transcription using Python and the SpeechRecognition library. By leveraging the Google Web Speech API, users can transcribe spoken language into text in real-time. The system prompts users to speak into the microphone, processes the audio data, and displays the transcribed text. Additionally, it saves the transcribed text to a file for future reference. With its simple setup and intuitive interface, this project offers a convenient solution for various applications requiring real-time speech-to-text conversion.
